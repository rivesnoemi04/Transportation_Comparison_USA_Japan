# Transportation_Comparison_USA_Japan
comparing transportation related emissions between the United States and Japan. Using RStudio to visualize emission data from both countries. 

# Let's begin!
Start by using the code in world-emmisions-sector.R to organize the emmisions-by-sector.csv Data. This Data has every country's emissions by sector from 1990 to 2022. In the world-emissions-sector.R, you will be filtering this data to visualize Worldwide emissions by sector in 2022.
Under the Folder "Plots", you will have two options on how to visualize these styles
# USA emissions
Now use the code under "Japan_USA_emmissions_bysector" to create visualizations of emission data from Japan and the US. You will be using the same dataset, but organizing it differently! The plots created in this step are located in the "plot" folder.
